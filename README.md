## BIO

For the past six years, I have been leading teams of technical and financial analysts, focusing on automated reporting and facilitating decision-making based on data. When I was an analyst myself, I always enjoyed creating reports and writing database queries. Today, the world of analytics has changed significantly - data is growing exponentially, new approaches and tools are emerging. In order to stay up to date with the latest trends, I strive to learn something new. Below, you can track my progress in this exciting new world.
